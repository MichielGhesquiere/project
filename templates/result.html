        <h2>Hypnogram</h2>
        <p>
            The hypnogram below provides a visual representation of the sleep stages predicted by the AI throughout the night. A typical night of sleep consists of multiple sleep cycles, each lasting approximately 90 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sleep cycles usually proceed from light sleep (N1 and N2) into deep sleep (N3), and then into REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. REM sleep is associated with vivid dreaming. It's normal to experience 4-5 sleep cycles during the night, with each cycle going through these stages.
        </p>
        <p>
            A healthy hypnogram typically shows well-defined and evenly spaced sleep cycles, with a balanced distribution of sleep stages. Interruptions or irregularities in the cycles may indicate disruptions in sleep quality.

    <h2>Sleep Stage Percentage</h2>
    <p>The chart below displays the percentage of time spent in each sleep stage.</p>
    <img src="data:image/png;base64,{{ sleep_stage_percentage_img }}" alt="Sleep Stage Percentage">
    
    <p>
        <strong>REM</strong> stands for rapid eye movement. In REM sleep, your muscles are relaxed but your brain is active. REM sleep restores your mind, and enhances memory and learning. This is the stage when dreaming mostly occurs. Most REM sleep occurs during the second half of the night. The amount of REM sleep is on average about 21% of sleep time for adults.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Deep sleep (N3)</strong> is the stage of sleep when it's hardest to be woken up. This sleep stage restores your body, supports your immune system, and affects muscle growth. It also affects certain aspects of memory and learning. Most deep sleep occurs during the first half of the night. On average, deep sleep accounts for about 15% of sleep time for adults.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Light sleep (N1 + N2)</strong> serves as a transition stage between wakefulness and the deeper stages of sleep. You can be easily awoken from light sleep since your responsiveness to environmental stimuli remains quite high. Light sleep also promotes mental and physical recovery, although REM and deep sleep are the most important sleep stages in that regard.
